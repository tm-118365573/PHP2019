                I attended CBS Kilkenny from 4th Year until 6th year. Once I had attended Gaelscoil Osraí and Colaiste Pobail Osraí for 11 years, I moved to CBS to improve my English as I had been speaking Irish and learning all
                the terms in every subject through Irish for my entire schooling life, so I decided to begin to learn them through english as they wouldnt be taught through Irish in College. 
                i left CBS 3 years after arriving with a very good Leaving Cert.

        <div class="subheading mb-3">St.Luke's Hopspital</div>
        <p>
            I spent 2 weeks in St.Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny when I was in Transition Year in CBS Kilkenny.
            During my Time there, I learnt a great amount about the Health care industry as well and attaining plenty 
            of new personal Skills. I became a far more punctual person due to the fact that my manager there was very strict with time keeping.
            I also became a far harder worker during my time due to the fact that when I was asked to do something, Someone's health was on the line and couldn't be nonchalant 
            during my time there and from then on, i have maintained that work Ethic
        </p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3">Moth to a Flame</div>
        <p>
            The second business Place that I attended was Moth to a Flame. It is a small candle making shop on the outskirts of Kilkenny.
            The shop is recognised globally as one of the best in the candle making industry. During my time there, i received a great 
            insight into how a small company consisting of only 2 employees can grow and prosper. I also became a more efficient worker
            while I was there due to the many jobs I was asked to do during my time there and working efficiently would allow me to get more done in the 
            same amount of time
        </p>        
        <div class="subheading mb-3">Kilkenny County Council</div>
        <p>
            During the summer of 2018, I became involved with the county council and worked for them for 10 weeks. During my time there, i was tasked with picking up Litter on the streets as well and helping out on construction Sites
            and cleaning up the graveyards in Kilkenny. A skill i attained from this job was computer skills. After each work Day, I 
            was requested to add my hours into a database in a computer in the county council offices. This became very useful 
            as it has helped me whilst I was doing this course.
