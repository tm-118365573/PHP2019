        <h2>Football</h2>
    </center>
        <p>
            I began playing football when I was 5 years old. I began playing with my local club Evergreen FC.
            I hated playing football at first however after one year, I began to love the sport. I played for the
            A team for 12 years until I was 17. I became captain for the team for a year when I was 14. We managed to reach the All Ireland Quarter Final during that season.
            When I was 18, I left the team to play Sunday League football for the same club due to the leaving Cert and the fact that football took
            up too much time.

            After the leaving cert was over, I attended the UCC trial for the UCC Freshers Football team. After
             6 trials, I was told that I made the team. We have played the majority of the season and have achieved a lot. The 
             highlight of the season was when we reached the All Ireland Final. We played in the Harding cup in Mid February. We stayed 
             in the Clayton Hotel in Dublin and had all of our meals prepared for us to ensure we played the best football that we could.
             Our first match was against Mary I in which we won 8-0 which put us into the All Ireland Semi-Final. In the Semi-Final,
             we Played against the Favourites UCD. Thanks to an early goal and some resolute defending, We managed to win 1-0 and get into the All
             Ireland Final and we would play against UL

         The All Ireland Final was a great experience. It was played at one of the best football pitches in Ireland at the UCD Bowl 
         on the UCD campus. The match was televised on the IUFU website, FaceBook and Twitter. It was very professional and even had an official 
         walkout. It was a very tight and cagey game however we lost 2-0. Even though we lost, it was one of the best 
         experiences of my life and greatly enjoyed every second of it.

        <p>
            Another sport I played as i grew up was Hurling. Growing up in Kilkenny, everyone plays hurling. Growing up, i played wioth my
            local club James Stephens GAA club. Some notable ex players include;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jackie Tyrell</li>
            <li>Eoin Larkin</li>
            <li>Matt Ruth</li>

        <p>
        I played for the club since I was 4 and also played with my school. I played Corner forward for both however, I never managed to 
        hold down a spot on the A team. I greatly enjoyed playing hurling when I was playing however I enjoyed playing football more
        so i gave it up when I was 16.
